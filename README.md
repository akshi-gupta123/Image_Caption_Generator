# Image_Caption_Generator

The project is to create Image Caption Generator App. The dataset used to train model is MS-COCO dataset. The dataset contains over 82000 images, each of which has at least 5 different caption annotations. 
In this project we used different Deep learning algorithms to create the model. We also develop android application which then we integrate with our deep learning model. 
The app takes an input image either using camera or from the gallery. Then it will redirect to generator page which will generate a caption as an output which describes that image.
